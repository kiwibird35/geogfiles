        "When the first time the function `countdown` is called, `n` is 3 and therefore it only prints the value of `n` and then calls itself. But this time it calls itself with an `n` value that is one less than the previous value. So we are essentially calling `countdown(2)`. The new call will again print the value of `n` because it does not satisfy the  `if` statement. Now the call becomes `countdown(1)`, which still triggers the printout of the `n` value and launches the last call of function `countdown` with an argument of 0. So finally we get to a condition that satisfies the `if` statement, which will go to run the line to print out the word `DONE`. This will be the end of all the calls because that the printout of DONE is the last thing the code does. For this reason, the condition in the `if` statement is also called a **base case** -- it is the bottom of the recursion and from there the function calls will trace back.\n",

The end of the function will be reached **after** the call of `countdown(2)` ends, which of course will not end until the call of `countdown(1)` ends, and so on.
