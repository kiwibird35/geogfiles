The word algorithm is from latin _algorismus_, which is from _al-Khwa-rizmī_, a Persian mathematician, astronomer, and geographer. There are two aspects to evaluate an algorithm: its **correctness** and **time complexity**. We focus on the latter here. Time complexity is also called running time, though the term \"running\" is not accurate because we are not really talking about how the algorithm actually runs but in theory how the computation grows with the problem size. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the fundamental concepts of time complexity. There will be four short videos associated this tutorial.

We will only touch the most basic ideas in this scope as a preparation for spatial indexing methods.\n",

        "Trees are an important means to organizing data. A **tree** contains multiple **nodes** where each node can have **child nodes** and **parent nodes**, except for the **root** node that does not have parent nodes and **leaf nodes** that do not have child nodes. The linkages between nodes are called the **edges**. The root serves as the access point to the entire tree. The tree illustrated above represents the sequence of numbers ranging from 1 to 7 in a **binary** fashion where each node can have up to two child nodes, and for each given node, the number that is smaller will be placed on the left child node and otherwise on the right child node.\n",
        "\n",
        "An important feature of trees is that they are structured so that we can conduct a **divide-and-conquer** approach to searching for information. Using a binary tree for example we can perform a **binary search** by excluding the nodes on one side of each node (starting at the root) and therefore expedite the search process. However, the trees for the same data can be constructed differently and one way to measure their difference is to count the number of edges one has to pass from the root to the leaf nodes.\n",

        "Which tree is \"better\" then? To answer this question, we need to introduce a few terminologies. The **depth** of a node is the number of edges on the path from the root to that node. The depth of the root is 0. There is at least a leaf node on the tree that has the deepest (with the highest number of edges) from the root, and we call this depth the **height** of the tree. The ideas of depth and height can also be looked at from the perspective of each node (we just pretend the node is the root and concentrate on all the child nodes from that node). This is what we call a **subtree**, formed by a node and all its child nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Every node on a tree has two subtrees, left and right. This leads to the definition of a **balanced tree**: a tree where the difference in the heights of the left and right subtrees of *any node* is no more than 1. A wordier way to say the same, but using the term depth, is this: a balanced tree is a tree where the difference in the depths of the deepest leaf nodes in the left and right subtrees of *any node* is no more than 1. To this definition (there are different definitions too), the above two tree are not balanced, but the first tree is.\n",

For example, we can insert a new node to between two nodes, or we can always insert child nodes to leaf nodes. We use the latter approach here.

If the difference between the heights of all leaf nodes is no more than 1, we say the tree is **balanced**. A perfectly balanced tree with a height of $H$ will be able to hold a total of $2^0 +2^1 +2^2 +...+2^H = 2^{H+1}−1$ items. In other words, if we have $n$ items that need to be indexed using a balanced tree, the height of that tree is of the order of, again using the Big-O notation,  $O(\\log_2n)$, which is also the running time of search using that tree. This is a significantly more efficient way of search with a **logarithmic time complexity**.\n",
